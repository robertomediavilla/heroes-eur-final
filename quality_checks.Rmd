```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

These are the anonymised datasets by country and the complete dataset

```{r import datasets}
ds <- readRDS("data/data_complete.rds")
ds_sp <- readRDS("data/data_Spain.rds")
ds_cr <- readRDS("data/data_Czech_Republic.rds")
ds_nl <- readRDS("data/data_Netherlands.rds")
ds_it <- readRDS("data/data_Italy.rds")
```

Each contributor could use this script or create his/her own to run quality
checks. Please make sure to use both code and text to provide as much
information as possible an ensure replicability. Please also use the package
todor to flag things to do (`todor::todo()`) or to fix (`todor::fixme()`).
